# ** SEI Project two: Reactathon**

## https://news-and-weather-worldwide.netlify.app/

## **Overview.**

Project 2 was my first experience pair coding. My self and my partner had to create a front end app using **React** and **Axios** to consume an **API** in under 2 days. We made the decision to build a News and Weather app with 2 seperate APIs both with rich data sources. 

-------------------------
## **Brief.**

#### Project brief:

* **Consume a public API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to your disgression and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.
